# rauc-github

The goal of this repo is to create a small service for Linux based embedded systems which can check
github repos for releases with compatible rauc update bundles. This service shall offer interfaces
(D-BUS, local http, unix socket) for components with user interaction to offer updates and initiate
the update process.
